Monarchy is a ruby gem offering a complete solution to manage an access in your web application.
Hierarchical structure and built-in roles inheritance options make it the most powerful tool to control an access to your resources.

Thanks to [closure_tree](https://github.com/mceachen/closure_tree), Monarchy can deliver the best in class algorithmic performance and allows you to forget about hierarchies and complicated structures.

It is like a [rolify](https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify) but with advanced possibilities to inherit roles and collect all accessible resources with just one method.

## Requirements
Monarchy requires:
  - Ruby 2.3
  - Rails 4.2 or higher
